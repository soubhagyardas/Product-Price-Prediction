# Product-Price-Prediction
This project is about detecting the right price of the product available in the app where some of the products were used or vintage or new.

In this competition, the challenge is to build an algorithm that automatically suggests the right product prices. The dataset is provided with user-inputted text descriptions of their products, including details like product category name, brand name, and item condition.
Retailx would like to put the best model into production and suggest users the realistic price along with the real time comparison, whenever any new item is getting uploaded for the sale.
